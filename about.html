      <p class="about-txt">
        This site is a presentation of my final assignment in the Javascript 1
        course at Noroff.
      </p>

      <p class="about-txt">
        The task was to make two calls to an API of my choice, which was the
        IMDb top 100 API from rapidAPI.
      </p>

      <p class="about-txt">
        The first call needed to fetch an array of results and present these in
        HTML on the homepage. I also needed to display at least 3 different
        properties recieved from the JSON fetched from the results.
      </p>

      <p class="about-txt">
        The second call needed to fetch a single result which, in turn, needed
        to be displayed on a details.html page. This page gets accessed by
        clicking on the card for each result on the homepage. Also here I needed
        to display at least 3 different properties as well as set the title of
        the page as one of the property values.
      </p>

      <p class="about-txt">
        Finally, I needed to create a contact page with a form with four
        different inputs. Each input needed to be validated when the form is
        submitted and display an error message if it didnt pass validation. If
        the form did pass validation, a message indicating succes was to be
        displayed above the form.
      </p>

      <p class="about-txt last-txt">Hope you enjoy the site!</p>
